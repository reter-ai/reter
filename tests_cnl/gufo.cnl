Use the various sub-properties provided in order to represent specific types of parthood.Proper parthood (and each of its sub-properties) is asymmetric and irreflexive. Nevertheless, these characteristics are not declared in this implementation since that would violate rules of OWL 2 DL that guarantee decidability of reasoning.

In this case, any change in the membership of the group (e.g., the addition of one person) would in fact create a different group of people. In this case, the gufo:FixedCollection may be contrasted with the complexes they constitute. For instance, The Beatles (the band conceived as a gufo:FunctionalComplex) was in a certain circumstance constituted by the collection {John, Paul, George, Pete} and in another one constituted by the collection {John, Paul, George, Ringo}.

Corresponds to `Quale` in Guizzardi (2005). Use this class only for quality values (qualia) that are to be reified in the A-box and associated with a gufo:ConcreteIndividual through the object property gufo:hasReifiedQualityValue.

Instances of `ShipType` such as `Supercarrier` and `Cargoship` should be declared subclasses of `Ship`. OWL 2 punning should be used to capture the two facets of `Supercarrier` and `Cargoship` in this example: (i) as instances of `ShipType`, and (ii) as subclasses of `Ship`.The categorized type is termed the `base type` in the `powertype pattern` see Carvalho et al (2017), the higher-order type is often called the `powertype`.  gufo:categorizes is the general (unspecific) form of categorization. See  gufo:partitions for a more specific form, in which instances of the categorized type are classified by exactly one instance of the higher-order type. The domain is gufo:Type excluding gufo:AbstractIndividualType as well as gufo:ConcreteIndividualTypes because those types are first-order types (their instances are individuals). Only instances of gufo:Type representing higher-order types can categorize a base type.For further details and formalization of `categorization`, see Carvalho et al (2017) which combines UFO with MLT (a multi-level modeling theory).

Use this property only for quality values that are to be reified in the A-box and associated with a gufo:ConcreteIndividual. Otherwise, use the gufo:hasQualityValue data property and a literal to determine the quality value.The full representation pattern for quality values involves first identifying a gufo:Quality that inheres in a concrete individual and then associating it with a reified quality value. For example, let us consider the color of Yves Klein`s `Blue Monochrome` painting made in 1961 (MoMA`s object with number 618.1967). In the full pattern, an instance of gufo:Quality that inheres in the physical object (the color of that painting) is associated with a gufo:QualityValue (say the triplet <0, 47, 167> for that painting) through gufo:hasReifiedQualityValue. The full pattern is recommended when different quality spaces are expected to be used for the same quality. For example, the color of that painting could also be associated with a quadruple <100, 72, 0, 35> representing the same color in a CMYK space.When the full pattern is not required, gufo:hasReifiedQualityValue can also be used to directly associate a concrete individual (without identifying the quality) with a quality value.'.

Partitions has-description equal-to 'Identifies a gufo:Type whose instances are classified by exactly one instance of the partitioning higher-order type.For example, `AnimalSpecies` gufo:partitions `Animal`. Instances of `AnimalSpecies` such as `Lion`, `Hiena` must be disjoint subclasses of `Animal`. OWL 2 punning should be used to capture the two facets of `Lion` and `Hiena` in this example: (i) as instances of `AnimalSpecies`, and (ii) as  subclasses of `Animal`.Note that the partitioned type (in the example `Animal`) may or may not be declared to be a disjoint union of the explicitly enumerated subclasses (such as `Lion`, `Hiena`). This is because other instances of the higher-order type (`AnimalSpecies`) may exist that are not explicitly enumerated in the ontology.The partitioned type is termed the `base type` in the `powertype pattern` see Carvalho et al (2017), the higher-order type is often called the `powertype`.  For further details and formalization of `partitioning`, see Carvalho et al (2017) which combines UFO with MLT (a multi-level modeling theory).  V. A. Carvalho, J. P. A. Almeida, C. M.

If X partitions Y then X categorizes Y.
Every-single-thing that partitions is a type and is not an abstract-individual-type and is not a concrete-individual-type.
Something is an aspect if-and-only-if-it-either is an extrinsic-aspect or is an intrinsic-aspect.
Every-single-thing that has-reified-quality-value is a concrete-individual.
If X is-collection-member-of Y then X is-object-proper-part-of Y.
Every-single-thing that is-collection-member-of is an object.
Every-single-thing concerns-related-endurant at-most one thing.
Every-single-thing that concerns-related-endurant is a temporary-relationship-situation.
X participates-in Y if-and-only-if Y takes-part-in X.
Every participation takes-part-in one object.
If X stands-in-qualified-instantiation Y then X stands-in Y.
Every-single-thing that stands-in-qualified-instantiation is an endurant.
Every temporary-parthood-situation concerns-temporary-whole one endurant.
Every temporary-parthood-situation is stood-in-qualified-parthood by one endurant.
Every-single-thing that depends-externally-on is an extrinsic-mode.
Has-Quality-Value is a datarole-type.
Has-Quality-Value has-description equal-to 'Determines a quality value associated with the concrete individual.Use gufo:hasReifiedQualityValue instead when quality values are reified.It is recommended that subproperties of gufo:hasQualityValue are created, possibly identifying the datatype to be used. For example, `hasTemperatureValue` could be defined as a sub-property of gufo:hasQualityValue whose domain is `Temperature` (specializing gufo:Quality) and whose range is xsd:double.'.
Every-single-thing that has-quality-value (some value) is a concrete-individual.
Anything either is an endurant, is an event or is a situation or-something-else.
Anything either is a collection, is a functional-complex or is a quantity or-something-else.
